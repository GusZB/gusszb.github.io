                    <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It’s just a little bigger than Earth’s Moon. Mercury itself, though, doesn’t have any moons. It is the closest planet to the Sun, but it’s actually not the hottest. Venus is hotter.</p>

                    <p>Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It has a solid surface that is covered with craters. Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury possesses a thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off the surface by the solar wind and striking meteoroids.</p>
                    <p>Mercury's exosphere is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. Mercury doesn’t have any moons.</p>
